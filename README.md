Memory Game
 User must click a different image every time.
 This game is not for winning but if you get all 12 images pat yourself on the back.

 We are grabbing images from the friends.json file and calling the image in the friendCard folder inside the friendsCard.js. The data that is being called is from App.js.

 App.js is using state objects that is being called in the handleincrement function. handleIncrement contains all the necessary functions, paramaters and object to make the game function. We are rendering the handleIncrement on line  73, which is being called on the friendCard.js file.

 Please note that the title folder is rendering the title on line 55 of App.js. As well as wrapper on line 63 through 73. The wrapper and tile are styling and rendering data form the app.js file to components folder.
